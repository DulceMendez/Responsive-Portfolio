    <h1>About Me</h1>
     <img src="assets/images/yo.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Dulce Mendez">
     <p> I was born in Mexico City. I am 34 years old. I like to be organized in everything that I do. I am a detail-oriented person and I like to be creative. My favorite color is lime green.</p>
     <br>
     <p> I like to do a little bit of exercise. I like running on the treadmill or around the lake, swimming in a pool, or riding a bicycle in the mountains. I miss listening to live rock, mariachi, or salsa music in Mexico City's pubs. I like to cook mexican food at home.</p>
     <br>
     <p> I worked from September 2009 to March 2016 at a public university (Instituto Politecnico Nacional or IPN) in Mexico City. I was an administrative assistant at the Human Resources department and at the Postgraduate department.</p>
     <br>
     <p> I received a B.S. in Industrial Management in November 2006 from the same university where I used to work. I lived my whole live in Mexico. I met my husband in Cancun, Mexico in July 2012 and we got married in March 2016 in Raleigh, NC.</p>
     <br>
     <p> I started working in July 2017 at a company that recycles computers. I work in the auditing area as an Asset Management Service Technician. I decided to change my career path when I heard about the UNC Coding Boot Camp. I would like to graduate and get a better job. </p>
